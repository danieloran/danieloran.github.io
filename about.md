Back in the day, as a program manager at Microsoft, I [created](https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/danieloran/2022/11/28/qa-about-the-windows-start-menu-and-taskbar/) the Windows Start Menu and Taskbar.

I was the last student of the behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner, who sent me to the Yerkes Regional Primate Center in Atlanta to try to [teach](https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/danieloran/about/) two teenage chimpanzees to talk. In the end, they taught me a lot more than I ever managed to teach them. And it sparked my interest in making things easier to use.

Over the years, I've worked on start-ups, written a few [novels](https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/01/beta-testing-a-novel-using-amazons-kindle/), encouraged people to [vote](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/10/moveon-victory-lab-voter-mobilization-obama-progressives/), and contributed to health [research](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-3012).

The huge advances in AI over the last few years have rekindled my interest in software. As Jeff Bezos might say, it feels very much like Day 1.
