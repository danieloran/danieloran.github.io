## Hello, world!

Back in the Bronze Age, as a program manager at Microsoft, I [created](https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/danieloran/2022/11/28/qa-about-the-windows-start-menu-and-taskbar/) the Windows Start Menu and Taskbar. I hear they're still being used. (These days, my primary computer is a Chromebook.)

I was the last student of the behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner, who sent me to the Yerkes Primate Center in Atlanta to try to teach two teenage chimpanzees to talk. In the end, they taught me a lot more than I ever managed to teach them. And it sparked my interest in making things easy to use.

Over the years, I've worked on start-ups, written a few novels, encouraged people to vote, and contributed to health research.

The huge advances in AI over the last few years have rekindled my interest in software. As Jeff Bezos might say, it very much feels like Day 1.
